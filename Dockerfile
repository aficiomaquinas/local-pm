# DATABASE_URI and PAYLOAD_SECRET are deliberately NOT build args: an ARG/ENV
# pair is baked into the image layers and readable by anyone with the image
# via `docker history`, so passing real secrets at build time leaks them.
# Both are injected at runtime by docker-compose instead.
#
# Nothing needs them during `next build`: every page that reads the database
# is `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`, so none are prerendered. The
# placeholder secret below only satisfies config validation during the build
# and is never the secret the running container uses.
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL stays a build arg because Next.js inlines NEXT_PUBLIC_*
# into the client bundle at build time, and it is public by definition.
